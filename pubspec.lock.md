# pubspec.lock

**Important**: This file should be automatically generated by running `flutter pub get` and should be committed to version control.

## What is pubspec.lock?

The `pubspec.lock` file is automatically generated when you run `flutter pub get` and serves as a lockfile that:

- **Locks exact versions** of all dependencies and their transitive dependencies
- **Ensures reproducible builds** across different environments and team members
- **Records the dependency resolution state** at a specific point in time
- **Prevents version conflicts** by maintaining a consistent dependency tree

## Why commit pubspec.lock?

Unlike Node.js packages where `package-lock.json` is sometimes ignored, Flutter applications **should commit** the `pubspec.lock` file because:

1. **Applications vs Packages**: This is an application, not a reusable package
2. **Reproducible builds**: Ensures all developers and CI/CD systems use identical dependency versions
3. **Stability**: Prevents unexpected behavior from automatic dependency updates
4. **Debugging**: Makes it easier to identify when issues were introduced by dependency changes

## When is pubspec.lock generated/updated?

The file is automatically created or updated when you run:
- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
- `flutter pub upgrade` - Update dependencies
- `flutter pub add package_name` - Add new dependency
- `flutter pub remove package_name` - Remove dependency

## First-time setup

If you're setting up this project for the first time and don't see a `pubspec.lock` file:

1. **Install Flutter** (3.0.0 or higher)
2. **Run dependency installation**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Verify the file was created**:
   ```bash
   ls -la pubspec.lock
   ```
4. **Commit the generated file**:
   ```bash
   git add pubspec.lock
   git commit -m "Add pubspec.lock for reproducible builds"
   ```

## Structure

The generated `pubspec.lock` file contains:

```yaml
# This file is generated automatically and should not be edited manually
packages:
  package_name:
    dependency: "direct main"  # or "direct dev" or "transitive"
    description:
      name: package_name
      sha256: "..."
      url: "https://pub.dev"
    source: hosted
    version: "1.2.3"
  # ... more packages
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing pubspec.lock
If the file is missing:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Dependency conflicts
If you encounter dependency resolution errors:
```bash
flutter pub deps  # Check dependency tree
flutter pub upgrade  # Update to compatible versions
```

### Corrupted lock file
If the lock file is corrupted:
```bash
rm pubspec.lock
flutter pub get
```

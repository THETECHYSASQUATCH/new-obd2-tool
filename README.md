## Usage

### Connecting to an OBD-II Device

1. **Bluetooth (Mobile)**:
   - Ensure Bluetooth is enabled
   - Pair your ELM327 adapter with your device
   - Launch the app and navigate to the Connection tab
   - Select your device from the list and connect

2. **WiFi (All Platforms)**:
   - Connect to your OBD-II adapter's WiFi network
   - Use the default IP address (usually 192.168.4.1) or scan for devices
   - Connect through the app

3. **USB/Serial (Desktop)**:
   - Connect your OBD-II adapter via USB
   - Select the appropriate COM port or device path
   - Configure baud rate if necessary (default: 38400)

### Performing Diagnostics

1. **Live Data**: View real-time engine parameters on the dashboard
2. **Scan DTCs**: Check for diagnostic trouble codes
3. **Clear Codes**: Reset stored error codes (use with caution)
4. **Custom Commands**: Send specific OBD-II PIDs for advanced diagnostics

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```

# macOS Platform Configuration

This directory contains macOS-specific configuration files for the Flutter application.

## Build Output

The CI/CD pipeline expects to find the built app at: `build/macos/Build/Products/Release/obd2_diagnostics_tool.app`

## Note

The macOS platform configuration may need to be generated using `flutter create --platforms=macos .` when Flutter is available in the CI environment.

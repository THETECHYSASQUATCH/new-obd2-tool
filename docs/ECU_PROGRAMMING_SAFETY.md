# ECU Programming Safety Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNINGS

ECU programming is a powerful feature that can permanently alter vehicle behavior. **ALWAYS** follow these safety guidelines:

### Before Programming
1. **Ensure vehicle is parked safely** in a secure, well-ventilated area
2. **Connect a battery charger** to maintain stable voltage during programming
3. **Verify programming file compatibility** with your specific vehicle
4. **Create a backup** of the original ECU data before making changes
5. **Have recovery procedures ready** in case of programming failure

### Programming Environment
- Use stable power supply (battery charger recommended)
- Ensure reliable connection (avoid wireless if possible)
- Minimize electrical interference
- Have adequate lighting and workspace

### Legal and Warranty Considerations
- ECU modifications may void vehicle warranty
- Some modifications may not be legal for road use
- Emissions-related changes may violate local regulations
- Consult local laws and regulations before programming

## Supported ECU Types

### Engine Control Module (ECM/PCM)
- **Purpose**: Engine management and performance
- **Modes**: Flash programming, calibration updates
- **Risks**: Engine damage if programmed incorrectly
- **Backup**: Critical - engine may not start without valid program

### Transmission Control Module (TCM)
- **Purpose**: Transmission shift patterns and operation
- **Modes**: Flash programming, adaptation values
- **Risks**: Transmission damage or poor shifting
- **Backup**: Important - may cause drivability issues

### Hybrid Control Module (HCM)
- **Purpose**: Hybrid system coordination
- **Modes**: Flash programming, calibration updates  
- **Risks**: Hybrid system malfunction
- **Backup**: Critical - affects vehicle operation and safety

### Body Control Module (BCM)
- **Purpose**: Lighting, comfort, security features
- **Modes**: Coding, configuration, adaptation
- **Risks**: Loss of convenience features
- **Backup**: Recommended - affects various systems

## Programming Modes

### Flash Programming
- **Description**: Complete ECU software replacement
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes typically
- **Recovery**: Requires professional equipment if failed

### Calibration Updates
- **Description**: Update calibration data only
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Duration**: 5-15 minutes typically
- **Recovery**: Usually recoverable with backup

### Adaptation/Coding
- **Description**: Change configuration parameters
- **Risk Level**: LOW to MEDIUM
- **Duration**: 1-5 minutes typically
- **Recovery**: Often reversible

## Emergency Procedures

### If Programming Fails
1. **Do not disconnect** power or communication
2. **Do not turn off** the vehicle
3. **Attempt recovery** using backup data
4. **Contact professional** technician if recovery fails
5. **Vehicle may need towing** to qualified repair facility

### Recovery Options
1. **Automatic recovery**: Some ECUs can self-recover
2. **Backup restoration**: Restore from created backup
3. **Professional recovery**: Specialized equipment may be required
4. **ECU replacement**: Last resort for completely failed units

## Best Practices

### File Management
- Verify file checksums before programming
- Keep organized backups with clear naming
- Document all programming sessions
- Test files on similar vehicles when possible

### Session Management
- Monitor progress continuously
- Don't attempt multiple simultaneous sessions
- Allow adequate time for completion
- Keep detailed logs of all activities

### Post-Programming
- Verify all systems function correctly
- Test drive in safe environment
- Monitor for error codes or issues
- Document any changes in vehicle behavior

## Manufacturer-Specific Notes

### Toyota/Lexus
- Requires security access for most programming
- Hybrid vehicles need special precautions
- Some models require dealer-level access

### Ford
- EcoBoost engines require specific calibrations
- Some modules need module configuration after programming
- VIN-specific programming may be required

### Honda/Acura
- VTEC systems require careful calibration
- CVT transmissions need adaptation after programming
- Some parameters require specific driving conditions to set

### BMW
- Extensive coding options available
- VIN-specific data often required
- Some modules require online authentication

### Mercedes-Benz
- SCN (Software Calibration Number) programming
- Star Diagnosis compatibility required for some functions
- Component protection may prevent unauthorized changes

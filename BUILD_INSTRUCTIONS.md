# Build and Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

This project requires Flutter SDK to be installed. Please ensure you have Flutter 3.16.0 or later installed.

## Initial Setup

After cloning this repository and checking out this branch, run the following commands to set up the project:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Generate Code Files

This project uses code generation for JSON serialization and other generated code. Run the build runner to generate all necessary `.g.dart` files:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 3. Clean and Rebuild (if needed)

If you encounter any build issues after the initial setup, try cleaning and rebuilding:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## What Was Fixed

This PR addresses major build failures by:

1. **Added Missing Model Files**: Created placeholder implementations for all missing model classes in `lib/core/models/`:
   - `language_config.dart` - Language configuration settings
   - `vehicle_info.dart` - Vehicle information and database structures
   - `ecu_programming.dart` - ECU programming session management
   - `cloud_sync.dart` - Cloud synchronization settings and sessions
   - `obd_response.dart` - OBD response parsing and data structures
   - `ai_diagnostic_result.dart` - Export reference to existing AI diagnostic models

2. **Fixed Import Issues**: Added `dart:math` import to `telematics_data.dart` to resolve missing mathematical function errors.

3. **Updated Dependencies**: Added missing `syncfusion_flutter_gauges` dependency to support Syncfusion gauge widgets.

4. **Maintained Compatibility**: All placeholder model classes include proper JSON serialization support and follow the existing code patterns.

## Next Steps

- The placeholder model files should be populated with proper data structures as development continues
- Run the build_runner command whenever you modify any `@JsonSerializable()` annotated classes
- Test the application to ensure all features work correctly with the new model structures

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `flutter pub get`
2. Clean and regenerate files: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
3. Check that your Flutter SDK version meets the minimum requirements (3.16.0+)
4. Verify that all import paths are correct in your IDE

## Generated Files

The following files will be automatically generated by build_runner:
- `*.g.dart` files for JSON serialization
- Any other code generation outputs specified in the project configuration

These files should not be manually edited and are excluded from version control.
